# SecureVote: A Decentralized Voting System

SecureVote is a side project created as part of a learning journey into blockchain and decentralized application (dApp) development. The goal is to explore how blockchain technology can be applied to build a secure, transparent, and decentralized voting system. While this project is not intended for production use, it serves as a great example of how modern tools and frameworks can come together to solve real-world problems.

## üéØ **What This Project Covers**

- **Decentralization:** Experimenting with storing votes on the blockchain to eliminate the need for central authorities.
- **Transparency:** Ensuring votes can be verified publicly while maintaining privacy.
- **Smart Contracts:** Learning to implement tamper-proof rules for voting via Solidity.
- **Web3 Integration:** Understanding how to connect user wallets and interact with blockchain data.
- **UI/UX:** Building a simple and intuitive interface using modern web technologies.

## üë©‚Äçüíª **Tech Stack**

### **Frontend (Client-Side)**
- **Framework:** [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)  
  For building the user interface and managing the app's routing.
- **Styling:** [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)  
  A utility-first CSS framework for rapid interface design.
- **Web3 Integration:** [Thirdweb](https://thirdweb.com/)  
  Simplifies blockchain interactions like wallet connections and transactions.

### **Smart Contracts (Backend)**
- **Language:** [Solidity](https://soliditylang.org/)  
  Used for writing the smart contracts that define the voting mechanisms.
- **Deployment Framework:** [Thirdweb](https://thirdweb.com/)  
  Makes deploying and managing contracts straightforward.
- **Blockchain Network:**  
  Contracts are deployed on the **Optimism Sepolia Testnet**, a low-cost environment for learning and experimentation.

## üöÄ **Getting Started**

This project is for learning purposes, but you can set it up locally to explore how it works:

### **Prerequisites**
1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/).
2. Install [Metamask](https://metamask.io/) or another Ethereum-compatible wallet.

### **Installation**
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/DaviDemarqui/secure-vote.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd secure-vote
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### **Run Locally**
1. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
2. Open your browser and navigate to:
   ```
   http://localhost:3000
   ```

## üìö **How It Works**

1. **Connect Wallet:** Users connect their Ethereum wallet (e.g., Metamask) to interact with the app.
2. **Cast Vote:** Select from the available voting options. The vote is securely recorded on the blockchain.
3. **Verify Results:** Results are publicly accessible and can be verified on the Optimism Sepolia Testnet.
